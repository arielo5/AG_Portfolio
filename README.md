# AG_Portfolio

## Description

The motivation for this project was to create my own personal portfolio webpage with all the skills I acquired so far. The reason for this is because to be able to sell myself to potential employers is to show them see what I can actually do with my skills and what I can provide to them. For this project I learn that to better improve myself I need to continuously learn all the new tips and knowledge that I can  implement in every project that I can get my hands on. With my projects i like to give them a more personal touch depending on each project that i work on. 

## Usage

On the webpage you will see an logo icon and a navigation bar on top with 3 links for about me, projects and contact. when you click on each one the UI scroll to the corresponding section. On the project section when you click the first image it will taken you to that deployed application. Also the page has a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport on various screens and devices.
