# AG_Portfolio

## Description

The motivation for this project was to update my own personal portfolio webpage with all the skills I acquired so far. The reason for this is because to be able to sell myself to potential employers is to show them see what I can actually do with my skills and what I can provide to them. For this project I learn that to better improve myself I need to continuously learn all the new tips and knowledge that I can  implement in every project that I can get my hands on. With my projects i like to give them a more personal touch depending on each project that i work on. 

## Usage

On the webpage you will see an logo icon and a navigation bar on top with a hamburger button that will dropdown the header with buttons for LinkedIn, GitHub, Resume and Contact, and also a small section for about me. When you click on each one of the button it will open another tab for the to the corresponding pages. On the lower part of the page it display all of my previous projects so far. Also the page has a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport on various screens and devices.
